The goal of this level is to read a random number from a server (localhost in this case) and send it back in little endian, nothing to explain here.

# Solution:

```python
# solve.py

from pwn import *

con = remote("localhost", 64000)		# connect to localhost on port 64000
print(con.recvline())				# receive the greeting message

line = con.recvline()				# receive the line containing the number
num = int(line.split("\'")[1])			# ['Please send ', '1948481594', ' as a little endian, 32bit integer.\n']

con.send(p64(num))				# convert to little endian

print(con.recv())				# receive the final message
```

```
$ python solve.py
