This challenge is just a simple reverse engineering task, from the challenge description we can guess that the binary is packed.

Using DIE (detect it easy), we can see that it's packed using UPX.

we can unpack it easily using UPX:

```
$ upx -d flag
                       Ultimate Packer for eXecutables
                          Copyright (C) 1996 - 2018
UPX 3.95        Markus Oberhumer, Laszlo Molnar & John Reiser   Aug 26th 2018

        File size         Ratio      Format      Name
   --------------------   ------   -----------   -----------
    883745 <-    335288   37.94%   linux/amd64   flag

Unpacked 1 file.
```

Now that the binary is unpacked, let's jump to ida and do some reversing.

We can see that the main function is copying the flag into rdx, if we follow it to the .data section we will get the flag.

# Solution:

Flag:  `UPX...? sounds like a delivery service :)`
