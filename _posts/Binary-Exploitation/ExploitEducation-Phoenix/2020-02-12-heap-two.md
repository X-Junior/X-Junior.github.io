  char name[32];
  int auth;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  while (1) {

    if (fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin) == NULL) break;

    if (strncmp(line, "auth ", 5) == 0) {
      auth = malloc(sizeof(struct auth));
      memset(auth, 0, sizeof(struct auth));
      if (strlen(line + 5) < 31) {
        strcpy(auth->name, line + 5);
      }
    }
    if (strncmp(line, "reset", 5) == 0) {
      free(auth);
    }
    if (strncmp(line, "service", 6) == 0) {
      service = strdup(line + 7);
    }
    if (strncmp(line, "login", 5) == 0) {
      if (auth && auth->auth) {
        printf("you have logged in already!\n");
      } else {
        printf("please enter your password\n");
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The is a classic use-after-free (**UAF**) exploit, if we enter **"auth AAAA"** the code allocates memory and stores it in **auth** then copies the name **AAAA** to **auth->name**, so far so good.

To login we need **auth** to point to a memory address and **auth->auth** not to be zero, we can't overflow **name** since there is a length checking **strlen**.

The bug here is that **reset** frees **auth** allocated memory but **auth** still points to that memory location which could contain anything, **auth** here is called a **dangling pointer**.

The way **strdup** function works is it uses **malloc** under the hood to allocate memory for a new string, and the way **malloc** works (in very little details) is that it first looks if there is a previously-freed chunk of  memory, and that chunk is big enough to service the request, it will use that freed chunk for the new allocation.

So if we allocated memory for **auth**, freed that memory then entered **service** the **strdup** function will use the previously freed memory address of **auth**, and now we can write anything to **auth->auth** (we are writing to **service** but **auth** points to that address already).

The goal here is only to change **auth->auth** to any thing so we will just use some junk.
