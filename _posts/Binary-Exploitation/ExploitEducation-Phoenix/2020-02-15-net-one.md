This code generates 4 random bytes integer and sends to to the receiver as raw bytes.

The goal here is to convert these bytes to a number then send it as ascii string to the server.

# Solution:

```python
# solve.py

from pwn import *

con = remote("localhost", 64001)		# connect to localhost on port 64001
print(con.recvline())				# receive the greeting message

num_bytes = con.recv(4)				# receive the 32bit random number (4 bytes)
num = str(u32(num_bytes))			# u32() to convert from bytes to integer
con.send(num + "\n")				# send the number as ascii string

print(con.recv())				# receive the final message
```

```
$ python solve.py
