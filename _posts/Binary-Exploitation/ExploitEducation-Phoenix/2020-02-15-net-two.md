This level gets 64 random bytes and stores them in **quad** then it loops over **quad** 8 bytes at a time and adds these bytes to **result**.

So we will read 8 long numbers, add them and send the sum back.

 It's important to account for potential integer overflow using the bit mask **0xffffffffffffffff**.

# Solution:

```python
# solve.py

from pwn import *

con = remote("localhost", 64002)		# connect to localhost on port 64002
print(con.recvline())				# recieve the greeting message
print(con.recvline())				# recieve the size message

sum = 0
for i in range(8):
	sum += u64(con.recv(8))			# receive size(long) bytes then convert to long number

sum &= 0xffffffffffffffff			# 64bit mask to avoid integer overflow 
con.send(p64(sum))				# send the resulting sum

print(con.recv())				# receive the final message
```

```
$ python solve.py

Welcome to phoenix/net-two, brought to you by https://exploit.education

For this level, sizeof(long) == 8, keep that in mind :)

You have successfully passed this level, well done!
